	<description><![CDATA[EOS-RS Damage Proxy Map: Türkiye (Turkey) and Syria, Earthquake, 21 Feb 2023, v0.4
<br><br>

The Earth Observatory of Singapore - Remote Sensing Lab (EOS-RS) created this preliminary Damage Proxy Map (DPM) depicting areas in Türkiye (Turkey) and Syria where significant changes occurred between 9 Feb 2023 and 21 Feb 2023, including the impact of the M6.3 aftershock (20 Feb 2023) but not including the direct impact of the M7.8 main shock (6 Feb 2023). This map was derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) before (12 Oct 2022 to 9 Feb 2023) and after (21 Feb 2023) the aftershock.
<br><br>

The image covers an area indicated by the large white polygon. Each pixel measures about 30 meters across. The colour variation from light blue to dark blue indicates increasingly more significant surface change. Preliminary validation was done by comparing with high-resolution optical imagery and media reports. This map could be used as a guidance to identify damaged areas, and may be less reliable over vegetated areas. Scattered pixels over vegetated areas may be false positives, and a lack of colored pixels over vegetated areas may not mean no damage.
<br><br>

The product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2022-2023), processed by ESA and analyzed by the Earth Observatory of Singapore - Remote Sensing Lab (EOS-RS) in collaboration with NASA-JPL and Caltech, using the Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) system originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, and modified at EOS-RS.
